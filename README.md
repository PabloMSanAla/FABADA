# Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for Data Analysis, FABADA.
Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for Data Analysis (FABADA) is a new Bayesian approach for noise reduction in one and two dimensional data. This algorithm was deloped during the  Master Thesis of Pablo M. Sánchez Alarcón directed by Yago Ascasibar Sequerios of the M.Sc. Theoritical Physics at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 

Along the code in this repository you will be able to reproduce the results obtained in the Master Thesis of Pablo M. Sánchez Alarcón (pdf also in repository).
With "Example_2D.py" you will reproduce the examples of the two dimensional astronomical images and running the "Example_1D.py" it will reproduce the one dimensional spectra.
